{"script":"Ahem.\n                  I apologize for the inconvenience, but unfortunally this man must go through a test.\n                The game is simple, he has a compact explosive device strapped to his chest.\n        In order to deactivate the device, someone must look somewhere on his body for a 3-numeral combination.\n                      However I must warn you, you're about to free a very sickened man, might as well be the Devil. The mundane things this man has done...\n                 His fantasies are nothing but unfit for mortal thought. His twisted world he dreams everynight he sleeps. It's awful.\n              If you put in the wrong code on purpose you will have 20 seconds to run before he explodes. Barely any time to warn others around him.\n                     The bomb is scripted and destructive, know that I'm not playing.\n                  If you put in the code correctly and free him, he will continue his next test. His test of remorse and new beginnings.\n                   Once I'm done talking the timer that will set the bomb off will start. He has 2 minutes.\n            Live or die, make your choice."}
